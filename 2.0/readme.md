Viper Printer, v2.0
===================

In May 2021, our coach began revisiting his old EV3-powered dot-matrix printer project.

This repo contains the LXF file for the v2.0 build of his Viper printer. The motor-driven tank tread belt remains the same, but much of the rest of the printer has been redesigned. The printer now uses flat panels to make a base, the same width as letter-size paper. 
Also the pen holder, print head, and paper advancing mechanism are all redesigned. 

Because the project evolved so quickly, there is not a specific Python script to work with this build of the printer. The v3.0 script will work with some adjustments to the spacing variables, and changing the direction of some motors (by adding or removing -1 multiplication).


What's included?

This 2.0 subdirectory contains no Python scripts, only the LXF file.
